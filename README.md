# first-extension README

This is the README for your extension "first-extension". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

# running the extension
after cloning the repo, open terminal and run "npm install"
then in the vscode, you can press F5 to run the extension, or there should be a button in the left side of the vscode that looks like
a beetle under the play icon called "Run and Debug".
Clicking on it you should see green play icon.
After that you can refresh the client.
